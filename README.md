Genetic Algorithm
Overview

This project implements a genetic algorithm, a heuristic search algorithm inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of candidate solutions (individuals) over multiple generations to find an optimal solution to a given problem.
Features

    Customizable genetic operators: mutation, crossover, selection
    Support for various encoding schemes: binary, real-valued, permutation, etc.
    Fitness function evaluation for objective assessment
    Parameter tuning options: population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, etc.
    Visualization tools for tracking the evolution process

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/genetic-algorithm.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd genetic-algorithm

    Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Configure the genetic algorithm parameters in the config.py file.
    Define the fitness function to evaluate the performance of candidate solutions.
    Run the genetic algorithm:

python genetic_algorithm.py

    Monitor the evolution process and analyze the results.

Example

python

from genetic_algorithm import GeneticAlgorithm

# Define the fitness function
def fitness_function(individual):
    # Calculate fitness score based on individual's characteristics
    return ...

# Initialize the genetic algorithm
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(population_size=100, mutation_rate=0.01, crossover_rate=0.8)

# Set the fitness function
ga.set_fitness_function(fitness_function)

# Run the genetic algorithm
best_solution = ga.run(max_generations=100)

print("Best solution found:", best_solution)
